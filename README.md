# Brewit

Brewit will be a web application for those that partake in the hobby of homebrewing various alcoholic beverages to find, save, comment on, like, and submit recipes.

Currently the application is in early development, and is undergoing a change in direction to use a NoSQL database, MongoDB, where it was previously using PostgreSQL.

This application will be build using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, as well as React.
